### Overview

You’ve already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises, but this time **we’re going to challenge you to work on a whole project with a small team.**

Not only will you be asked to **exercise additional creativity** in designing your own project, your instructors will partner you with other classmates to architect, design, and collaboratively build an API of your own design.

While your last project taught you how to get started with Ruby, SQL, & Ruby on Rails, this project you'll be building something exciting with **Express & Mongo & AJAX**

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** It’s a lot harder to work in a team than to work by yourself, but that's most likely you’re going to find yourself doing in your first development job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome.

### Before you start coding

* Have your project idea approved by an instructor

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Use Mongo & Express** to build an API and a front-end that consumes it
* **Create an API using at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
* Include **all major CRUD functions** in a **RESTful API** for at least one of those models
* **Consume your own API** by making your front-end with HTML, Javascript, & jQuery
* **Add authentication to your API** to restrict access to appropriate users
* **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team
* **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard Git flow on Github
* Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publically accessible


---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A handmade front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome

---

### Git Collaboration

* Your group will elect a **Git Czar** to handle merging all pull requests. This person will be making sure any mergable commits are safe and able to be merged into the master branch. 
* When you are done working on a feature, a pull request will be submitted. The person making the pull request is responsible (in collaboration with others if neccessary) for making sure that the PR is mergable.
* Don't make your feature branches too large or leave them out of master for too long, ideally you should be creating and merging a feature branch within a couple of days.
* Refer to the [git branching lesson notes if helpful](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi_lettuce_students/blob/master/w08/d04/INSTRUCTOR/branching.md)

---

### Standup / Trello

* Your trello board should have individual tasks that are assigned to each person, tagged with a given feature.
* Standup should happen for every day you agree to work, or everyday someone is working. 
* It should include 3 things: What I got done yesterday, what I am doing today, what my blockers are. (blockers are anything that you are waiting on that's not in your control)

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)_
